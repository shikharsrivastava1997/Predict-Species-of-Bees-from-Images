# Predict-Species-of-Bees-from-Images
Can a machine distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee? Being able to identify bee species from images, while challenging, would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. In this Project, we will use the Python image library Pillow (PIL) to load and manipulate image data. We'll learn common transformations of images and how to build them into a pipeline.  This project is a walk through working with image data, building classifiers using traditional techniques, and leveraging the power of deep learning for computer vision.
